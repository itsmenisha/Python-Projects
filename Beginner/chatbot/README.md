# ChatBot

This is a simple ChatPot that has a api of  I created using Tkinter. It is one of the first projects of this beginner journey I am on. Maybe it's not much, but I learned about how weather open APIs work. 


## Installation & Setup

1. Download the files from the repository.
2. Create a `.env` file and add your API key under the name `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`. Get your API key from this link;
   
   ```
  API_KEY=your-api-key (don't include spaces)
   ```
3. Run the application by clicking on the `.py` file.
