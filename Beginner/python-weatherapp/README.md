This is a weather app I created using Tkinter. It is one of the first projects of this beginner journey I am on. Maybe it's not much, but I learned about how weather APIs work. Along the way, I faced many challenges, but it was a fruitful experience.

To make it fun, I designed the weather app with a **Howl's Moving Castle** theme to keep myself motivated. I used **Canva** to edit the background and enhance the overall aesthetic.

The new things I learned were PIL and how it works, as well as how APIs function. Additionally, I gained more knowledge about handling `.env` files for storing sensitive information and working with fonts in a GUI application.

## Installation & Setup

1. Download the files from the repository.
2. Create a `.env` file and add your API key under the name `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`. Get your API key from this link; you have to log in to get it. The API used is "Current Weather Data."
   ```
   OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your-api-key (don't include spaces)
   ```
3. Install the font `Albertus Bold.ttf`.
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   This also includes the requirements to handle photos and APIs.
5. Run the application by clicking on the `.py` file.
